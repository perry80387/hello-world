# hello-world
My first repository

Hi. My name is Matt. I'm starting a course to learn CAD soon, but I want to learn coding as well. 
I want to start a website which called "Type One trends" Which tracks and promotes trends in World peace, new technology, new energy, and intelligent government reform.
